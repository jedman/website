					<h3>Large-scale dynamics in single-column models</h3>
						<p>&nbsp&nbsp Single-column models of the atmosphere, such as cloud-resolving models, are widely used to study the dynamics of moist convection and develop parameterizations of convection for global climate models.  By definition, single-column models do not resolve large-scale circulations, and this limits the scope of questions that can be addressed with this technique. We can relax some of these restrictions by developing methods to allow single-column models to prescribe their own large-scale dynamics in a way that is consistent with their internal dynamics and a reference environment we imagine them to be immersed in. </p>
						<p>&nbsp&nbsp In <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-13-0327.1">An improved weak-pressure-gradient approximation for single-column modeling; <strong>(Edman and Romps, JAS 2014)</strong></a>, we introduce a new form of one of these schemes, the weak-pressure-gradient (WPG) approximation, which represents the interaction between the modeled column and the large-scale environment as a damped gravity wave of a single wavelength. Prior implementations of WPG suffer from a gravity-wave resonance which is undesirable for single-column modeling; we show that our new version does not suffer from this resonance and capably captures the dynamical coupling between the column and large-scale environment in an idealized shallow water system. </p>
						<p>&nbsp&nbsp As a follow up, we compared WPG and WTG using a 3D cloud-resolving model in a novel experimental framework we called 'self-consistency tests.' In these experiments, we test whether or not a cloud-resolving model coupled to WPG or WTG can reproduce its own behavior. For radiative-convective equilibrium experiments, the results were surprising-- none of the large-scale dynamics parameterizations reproduced the same equilbrium state as the uncoupled model. Clearly, there is still much to be learned about how convection couples to large-scale circulations. For more details, see <a href= "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014MS000378/full">  Self-consistency tests of large-scale dynamics parameterizations for single-column modeling <strong>(Edman and Romps, JAMES 2015)</a>.
